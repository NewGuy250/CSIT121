				<h2 class="header">What is this website for?</h2>
				<p class="body">Hello, my name is Daniel. I created this website to show off the photos I've taken ever since I've gotten into photography. The camera I own is a Panasonic LUMIX G95. Not all the photos on this website are from my camera, it could also be my phone. <br> I drew inspiration to make this website from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" class="hyper-link" target="_blank">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.wix.com/" class="hyper-link" target="_blank">Wix</a>.<br> I got inspiration from those websites because they both are ways for people to share photos they take, whether it's through social media or a blog. <br> On this website you will mostly find photos of my travels, food, and cat named Ping Pong. <br> I hope you enjoy!</p>

				<h2>More Facts</h2>
				<p class="table-description">The table below tells you how many photos I took on my LUMIX camera alone for each month in 2023. The reason I took a lot of photos in June is because I was on vacation. While in April my allergies were kicking my butt, hence why I took so few.</p>
