			<p id="intro">Something new that I started to get into is reading manga.
			<br>
			I've always been an anime fan, but I actually sometimes get tired of looking at a screen.
			<br>
			I find it very relaxing to read, however I don't think I would enjoy reading books.
			<br>
			Some things I've read are Chainsaw Man and Black Clover.
