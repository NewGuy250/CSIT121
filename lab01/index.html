<p>This is my favorite recipe because I usually have all the ingredients on hand, and my mom used to make me this when I was younger all the time. Everytime I eat eggs cooked this way it just brings some nostalgia to me. <b>I personally do add water to my eggs, because it thins it out and makes it fluffier.</b></p>
